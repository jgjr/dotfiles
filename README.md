# Dotfiles

Here are my personal dotfiles. I move these into my home directory with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). Included are some of the scripts I use regularly to organise files and look things up online, the configuration files for my window manager (i3) and the various applications I use along side it.
